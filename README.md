# Hidden Browser Project

A simple project that swap SetWindowDisplayAffinity values. Yeah that's basically it.

## If Youâ€™re Feeling Fancy

You can swap out QWebEngineView with [CefSharp](https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp) (for .NET projects) and build upon this idea further.
But it sometimes won't work with an external window so be warned.

- **No Back Option:**  
  There's no "BACK" button. Once you go in you can't go back
